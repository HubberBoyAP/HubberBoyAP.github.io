                    Endearingly nicknamed the "GodFather of Gangester Rap", Eazy-E was known for his distinctive delivery, charismatic flow, and enjoyably hyperbolic lyrics. Also a key member of N.W.A, one of the most influential Hip Hop groups in rap history, Eazy-E helped pioneer a movement that motivated the urban youth towards social rebellion for years to come.

                        Coming straight from the dungeons of New York rap, and one of the undisputed greatest MC's of all time, Nas is not only know for densely packed lyrical content, but a flow that is likened to flowing water. 
                        And in contrast to the happy music of the 80's and 90's, Nas gave an unapologetic window into the drugs, sex, and violence of Queens, New York.

                     Considered to be one of the two great martyrs of rapdom (along with 2pac), the Notorious B.I.G., also known as Biggie Smalls was known for his sharp tongue and brilliant rhyming scheme, and was one of the premier legends of New York Rap. Unfortunately his career was cut short when he was shot and murdered in 1997.
